    <title>My Dream Drumset</title>

    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Since I was born, I have always had a natural gift for rythym and drumming. I have never had the home space or money to afford my own drumset, but luckily I had friends who let me play on theirs while being in a band.
        I have always wanted to have my very own custom drumset made by Truth. So I have here a picture of what I would idealy have as my set and a list of the pieces I would need to make this set.
